**Linkedin history and Github project scraper**

The purpose of this project is for updating my website.
There will probably be drastic changes in case I pivot, if I do I will update it here.

This application will scrape Linkedin and Github (either through conventional scraping methods or through their rest apis)
and generate json files for your professional history.

Use these JSON files however you like but I plan on using it to update my portfolio site.

I'm realizing now that you may need to setup your own application on the linkedin apps portal to do this, but will update with more info later.


**Requirements**
1. A Linkedin account which you can obtain [here](https://www.linkedin.com/start/join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fgroups%2F&trk=uas-consumer-login-internal-join-lnk)
2. A github account
