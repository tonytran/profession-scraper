**Linkedin history and Github project scraper**

The purpose of this project is for updating my website.
There will probably be drastic changes in case I pivot, if I do I will update it here.

This application will scrape Linkedin and Github (either through conventional scraping methods or through their rest apis)
and generate json files for your professional history.

Use these JSON files however you like but I plan on using it to update my portfolio site

**Requirements**
1. A linkedin account
2. A github account
3. A linkedin developers account.
